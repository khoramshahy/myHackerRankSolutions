solution:
1) we have 8 set of 3 numbers that the sum of each collection is equal to same number.
    first we want to find this same number:

    we have three row that the sum of each row is equal to other tow rows.
    if we consider the sum of each code is m, we have this equation:
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 3m => 45 = 3m => m = 15

    so we see that sum of each row and as a result sum of all  

2) by finding the same number we only have 8 possible set of 3 numbers that the sum of them is 8.
    they are:
        1 5 9
        1 6 8
        2 4 9 
        2 5 8 
        2 6 7
        3 4 8
        3 5 7
        4 5 6

3) by counting the repetition of each number in the above 8 sets we see that:
        5 is repeated 4 times.
        each other odd nums are repeated 2 times
        and each even nums are repeated 3 times  

    so by considering the position of cell in the magic square we consider that according to the repetition of each num,
        5 is located in the center of square
        even nums are located in the corners
        and odd nums are in the middle of sides

4) so by finding the rules, now if we place 2 at the top right corner,
    the only possible num to place at the bottom left corner is 8,
    and the tow only remained even nums are 4 and 6 that can be placed in the tow remained corners.
    one time we can place 4 at top left corner and the other time we place it at bottom right corner.
    and each even numbers only has one cell to fit the rull(sum of each set is 15).

    so by puting 2 at top right we have only tow possible magic square.
    by doing this process for the three remained even nums we totally have
    (4 * 2 = 8) eight magic square. they are:

        2 9 4   |   2 7 6   |   8 3 4   |   8 1 6
        7 5 3   |   9 5 1   |   1 5 9   |   3 5 7
        6 1 8   |   4 3 8   |   6 7 2   |   4 9 2
    __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ __

        4 9 2   |   4 3 8   |   6 1 8   |   6 7 2
        3 5 7   |   9 5 1   |   7 5 3   |   1 5 9
        8 1 6   |   2 7 6   |   2 9 4   |   8 3 4
